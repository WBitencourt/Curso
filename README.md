  Add project the library TouchableHighlight. Then I learned to add numbers and clean them using a button... the property used were         onPress and onLoadPress.
  
  Moreover, the objective this class was see how the state of the components works. Using the function setState() to attribute the values   to the Text that showed in the screen when thee button is clicked.
