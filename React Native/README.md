  Add project the library TouchableHighlight. Then I learned to add numbers and clean them using a button... the property used were         onPress and onLoadPress.
  
  Moreover, the objective this class was see how the state of the components works. Using the function setState() to attribute the values   to the Text that showed in the screen when thee button is clicked.

  App task is done. I liked the experience in that projec, I learn more about CRUD, function sended by props that will be called inside son but executed inside father, callbacks at setState and the time life of react native, is the similar with asp.net aspx, it is the framework that I work currently. But with what I've learned so far I believe I can do something myself, next step is learn about create my own backend and step 2, do the same at Firebase (cloud backend).

  In that reflesh, I learned how to create a API REST in JavaScript with Express, using some tecnology and method to authenticate a user that new to me. I had difficulties with   the passport, some things changed in the way of calling the authenticate and the course was out of date, with some research I was able to identify the error and correct it.
